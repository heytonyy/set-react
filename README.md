# SET
###### by: heytonyy

<br>
This is a full stack lite MongoDB/Express/ReactJS app that simulates a timed based card game of Set[^1]

I've always had a huge love for any sort of puzzle / problem / riddle / quirky-like games. I dont remember when I first learned about the game of Set, but I instantly fell in love with it. Occaionally I play the Daily Set[^2], but I hand the idea to make my own version after learning the ReactJS framework.

TODO:
1. Deploy
2. Domain Name
3. Other Ideas:
    - button to post to FB/twitter "I just played Set and got a score of: {score}. Play at <"this link">". Look up Twitter Intent API
    - Make other fun 2D games
    - Build an app with all the 2D games --> Like Foony
